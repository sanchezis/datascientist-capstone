## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

This project uses Python 3, along with Jupyter Notebook. The following libraries are necessary for running the notebook:
* Pandas
* Numpy
* MatplotLib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-Learn
* pyspark with a correct Spark version installed

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, It is needed to understand the Sparkify project files and how we can extract information about how to predict churn users for better business revenue.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The main code for this project is included in the notebook `sparkify.ipynb`. The notebook walks through all the steps of the Process for analyzing the dataset to answer the question: can we predict the churn users?. The code and results are also posted on Medium as a [blog post](https://medium.com/@issanllo/predicting-customer-churn-with-spark-and-python-df8d1c5c5dc7).

Data for the project is not included because of large file sizes. To properly run the notebook, it must be placed in `data`. The directory should have the following files:
* `mini_sparkify_event_data.json`

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@issanllo/predicting-customer-churn-with-spark-and-python-df8d1c5c5dc7).
